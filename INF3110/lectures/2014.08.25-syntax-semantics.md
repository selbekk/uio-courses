## Syntax / Semantics

### Overview
- Program <> program execution
- Compiler / interpreter
- Syntax
    - Grammars
    - Syntax diagrams
    - Automata / State machines
    - Scanning / Parsing
- Meta-models

### Syntax vs Semantics
- Syntax = How do legal programs look like?
- Semantics = What does the sentences in this program mean?
- Static vs dynamic semantics
    - Static: Rules that can be checked before execution of program
    - Dynamic: ^, while program executes

### Compiler / Interpreter
- A compiler translates a program from one language to another language
- An interpreter reads a program and simulates its operations


### BNF grammar
- production = "rule"
- e = expression, n = number, d = digit
- ``::=`` is a meta-symbol, as a part of a meta-language
- Extended BNF gives us some more tools to express languages
- Unambiguous vs ambiguous grammars
    - If every sentence in the language can be derived by one and only one parse tree, then the grammar is unambiguous. Otherwise, it's ambiguous.
    - Ambiguity is handled by associativity and precedence rules

### Alternatives to grammars
- Syntax diagrams
- Automata / State machines


### Scanning (tokenizer)
- Finds tokens and groups stuff

### Parsing
- Check that a sentence (or a program) is syntactically correct
- Top-down vs bottom-up parsing
- LL(1) parsing is a very popular top-down parsing algorithm that is used in most popular compilers today.

### Meta-models
- Alternative to the LL(1) parser algorithm
- Class-based instead of function-based
